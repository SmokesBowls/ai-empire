	"visual_analysis": "I observe the cosmic interface during dragon communication. The dragon has just communicated: 'The cosmic interface pulses with acknowledgment. Reality patterns shift subtly around you as the command center recognizes your presence.'. The interface shows a sophisticated reality manipulation command center with central navigation systems, entropy controls for temporal adjustments, reality control panels, timeline anchor systems, and dimensional monitoring displays. Complex geometric patterns suggest cosmic-scale reality engineering capabilities.",
