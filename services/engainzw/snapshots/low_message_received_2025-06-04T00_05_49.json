The interface shows a sophisticated reality manipulation command center with central navigation systems, entropy controls for temporal adjustments, reality control panels, timeline anchor systems, and dimensional monitoring displays. Complex geometric patterns suggest cosmic-scale reality engineering capabilities.",
