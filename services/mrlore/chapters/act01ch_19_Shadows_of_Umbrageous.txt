 Chapter 18: Shadows of Umbrageous

The Seed Jump tore reality apart around them.

Viên and Keen had experienced the disorienting sensation once before, during their desperate leap from Xytheria to Pyroclast. But this time felt different—more violent, as if the emergency protocol itself was breaking down.

Their bodies stretched across space-time, consciousness fragmented into countless shards as the Void Spire's energy catapulted them toward Umbrageous. Colors inverted, sound became texture, and the very concept of self began to dissolve.

In this moment of cosmic vulnerability, something stirred within Viên.

His temporal patterns flared erratically, not just from the strain of the jump but from something deeper, something awakening. Behind his eyes, a vision coalesced—not of Umbrageous, nor of their destination, but of something within himself.

Blood. His blood, but not his blood. Draco blood transformed, twisted into something ancient and terrible. He saw his own body suspended in darkness, but the blood pouring from it didn't fall—it rose, coiling into tendrils that pulsed with malevolent intelligence. The tendrils formed a grotesque shape around his body, using him as a host, a puppet, his consciousness trapped but aware.

 What am I seeing?  his fractured mind wondered.  What is this thing inside me? 

The blood creature turned what might have been a face toward him, its features formed from his own essence. Recognition flickered in eyes made of crimson plasma. It knew him. Had always known him. Had been waiting.

The vision collapsed as suddenly as it had formed, reality snapping back into focus as they completed the Seed Jump. Viên and Keen crashed onto solid ground, the violent transition from trans-dimensional travel to physical existence knocking the breath from their lungs.

They lay still for several moments, gasping, adjusting to the return of normal sensory input. Keen recovered first, pushing herself up onto her elbows to survey their surroundings.

"Viên?" she called, voice hoarse. "Are you alright?"

He didn't respond immediately, his mind still reeling from the vision. What had he seen? A possible future? A warning? Or merely a hallucination caused by the Seed Jump's strain on his consciousness?

"Viên?" Keen's voice sharpened with concern.

He forced himself to sit up, temporal patterns still pulsing erratically beneath his skin. "I'm... here," he managed, though he wasn't entirely sure that was true. Part of him felt left behind in that vision, trapped with whatever entity lurked within his blood.

"Where are we?" he asked, finally taking in their surroundings.

They had landed in a vast plain covered in fine, gray ash that stretched to the horizon in all directions. The sky above was locked in permanent twilight—neither day nor night, but a haunting in-between state where stars were visible while ambient light suffused the landscape. Dark, jagged mountains rose in the distance, their peaks lost in low-hanging clouds.

Keen stood, brushing ash from her clothing. "This must be Umbrageous," she said. "Based on what Aetheric Coil told us, we should have landed somewhere in the Ashfall Plains."

Viên felt a strange resonance at those words. Ashfall Plains. The name stirred something within him—recognition, memory, though he was certain he'd never been here before.

"Your homeland," Keen added, studying his reaction. "According to the information Aetheric Coil shared, you're of Zaryonic lineage. This is where your bloodline originated."

Viên rose to his feet, the ash swirling around his boots. The landscape called to him in ways he couldn't articulate—a bone-deep familiarity that transcended his conscious mind.

"I feel it," he said quietly. "Like I've returned to something I never knew I lost."

A distant howl echoed across the plains, followed by another, then several more—a chorus of unearthly voices that made the ash dance in spiraling patterns.

"We should find shelter," Keen suggested, her hand moving to the weapon at her side. "The Seed Jump doesn't exactly provide a precise landing point. We need to get our bearings and locate the dormant Void Spire."

Viên nodded, but his attention had been captured by something half-buried in the ash a few meters away—a formation of crystalline structures that pulsed with faint, familiar energy. Without explanation, he moved toward it, dropping to one knee to examine the object more closely.

"What is it?" Keen asked, moving to join him.

Viên didn't answer. His hands trembled slightly as he brushed away the ash, revealing what appeared to be a fragment of obsidian glass, etched with patterns nearly identical to the ones that flowed beneath his own skin.

"Temporal patterns," he whispered, more to himself than to Keen. "Like mine."

Before Keen could respond, the distant howls grew louder, closer. She turned toward the sound, her form shifting partially into her spiritual state—a defensive reflex that had saved them numerous times before.

"We're not alone," she warned.

Viên reluctantly pocketed the obsidian fragment, rising to his feet. The howls were closing in from multiple directions, and now they could see movement along the horizon—dark shapes racing across the ash with unnatural speed.

"This way," Viên said, pointing toward a formation of twisted, petrified trees that might offer some cover. His temporal abilities would be their best defense, but the Seed Jump had drained him significantly. He needed time to recover.

They ran, ash billowing behind them like ghostly phantoms. The petrified forest loomed closer, its branches reaching toward the twilight sky like supplicating hands. Just as they reached its edges, a figure materialized before them, seemingly stepping out of the ash itself.

"Halt, travelers," the figure commanded, voice resonating with harmonic overtones.

Viên and Keen froze, confronted by a being unlike any they had encountered before. Tall and unusually proportioned, with skin the color of ash marked by slowly pulsing veins of cobalt and violet light. No hair adorned the being's head, replaced instead by calcified filaments arranged in a crown-like formation. Most striking were the eyes—like smoldering glass, pupilless but intensely aware.

"We seek passage," Keen said cautiously. "We mean no harm to your world."

The figure studied them both, gaze lingering on Viên. "Draco essence | Temporal echo | Void-touched," the being intoned in a strange triadic speech pattern. "You return to ash. We have waited."

Viên felt a chill run down his spine. "You know what I am?"

"Not what. Who." The figure moved closer, examining Viên with unsettling intensity. "Zaryon's path | Viên's echo | Lineage returned."

"My name is Viên," he confirmed, struggling to understand the being's cryptic speech. "We've come seeking the dormant Void Spire. We need to activate it to warn Earth about a threat."

The being tilted its head, as if listening to voices they couldn't hear. "I am Khal-Zur Viên'Tal, Rite-Architect of the Ember Ecliptic. The ash recognizes your pattern. Follows your shadow-form."

Keen glanced at Viên, confusion evident in her expression. "He seems to know you."

"Not me," Viên realized. "My bloodline. The Draco essence."

Khal-Zur nodded slowly. "Blood remembers | Time forgets | Ash preserves. Come. The hunters approach. We offer sanctuary."

As if on cue, the howling intensified, much closer now. Looking back, they could see dark shapes emerging from the swirling ash—creatures that moved with predatory grace, their forms shifting between solid and shadow.

"Umbral Stalkers," Khal-Zur explained. "They hunt resonance. Your arrival has... disturbed the ash."

The being turned and moved into the petrified forest with unexpected fluidity, clearly expecting them to follow. With little choice and the hunters closing in, Viên and Keen hurried after their mysterious guide.

The forest grew denser as they progressed, the twisted trees forming corridors and chambers of petrified wood. Khal-Zur moved with certainty, occasionally touching a tree trunk to leave behind a glowing symbol that faded moments later.

"Entropy markers," the being explained without being asked. "They erase our presence from time's perception."

After several minutes of silent travel, they emerged into a circular clearing where the ash had been swept away to reveal intricate patterns carved into the stone beneath—geometric designs that pulsed with the same energy Viên had felt in the obsidian fragment.

Khal-Zur gestured for them to step into the center of the pattern. Once they complied, the being pressed both hands against the ground, causing the carved lines to illuminate with cobalt light. The light spread upward, forming a dome around the clearing.

"Now we may speak freely," Khal-Zur announced, straightening. "The Umbral Stalkers cannot penetrate this sanctuary."

"Thank you for your help," Keen said cautiously. "But why assist us? You don't know our purpose here."

"Purpose is known | Blood is recognized | Void calls to void." Khal-Zur turned to Viên. "You carry Zaryon's mark. The ember-blood. You seek the Void Spire to return to your world."

Viên's temporal patterns flared briefly beneath his skin. "You know of the Void Spires?"

"All who remember the Culling know of the spires," Khal-Zur replied, moving to what appeared to be an altar of obsidian glass at the clearing's edge. "They were sealed when the sun failed. When twilight became eternity."

The being retrieved an object from the altar—a fragment of bone that pulsed with faint crimson light. "This is what remains of the original Viên. Your namesake. Your ancestor."

Viên accepted the bone fragment hesitantly, nearly dropping it when it pulsed in synchronization with his own temporal patterns.

"I don't understand," he admitted. "Who was the original Viên? What is my connection to this place?"

Khal-Zur's eyes flared briefly. "The original was guardian | sacrifice | bridge. When the Culling came, when the spires failed, Viên remained. Held the ash-gate open so others might escape. Became one with the twilight."

Keen moved closer to Viên, her expression concerned. "The Culling... is that when Umbrageous lost its sun? When it was trapped in twilight?"

"Yes," Khal-Zur confirmed. "The Culling of Light. When the Anunnaki Queen reached through time to sever star from world. To prepare the way for the Fifth Coming."

Viên felt a flicker of recognition at those words. The Fifth Coming—Mr. GPT had mentioned it, though he'd never fully explained its significance.

"We need to find the dormant Void Spire," Viên pressed, focusing on their immediate mission. "Can you guide us there?"

"The spire sleeps beneath the City of Echoes," Khal-Zur explained, gesturing toward the distant mountains. "Three days' journey across the ash. But its Observer—Lentharis—has withdrawn into the spaces between reality. Without awakening Lentharis, the spire remains dormant."

"And how do we awaken this Observer?" Keen asked.

"Resonance | Sacrifice | Recognition." Khal-Zur studied Viên intently. "The temporal one must offer what was lost. The shadow one must bridge what was broken. Together, you may reach where Lentharis hides."

Viên exchanged a glance with Keen. This was similar to how they had awakened Aetheric Coil on Pyroclast—combining his temporal perception with her spiritual ability.

"We've done something like this before," Viên confirmed. "But we'll need to reach the City of Echoes first."

Khal-Zur nodded solemnly. "When the ash-light fades, we will journey together. The Umbral Stalkers hunt by resonance. They sleep when the light shifts."

"The light shifts?" Keen asked. "I thought this world was in permanent twilight."

"Permanent, yes. Unchanging, no." Khal-Zur gestured toward the sky, where subtle variations in the cloud patterns created shifting bands of lighter and darker regions. "The ash-light cycles. What you call day and night, we call waking ash and sleeping ash."

The being moved to the edge of the sanctuary, studying the patterns of light in the sky. "Rest now. Recover your strength. The journey to the City of Echoes is arduous, and the Ashfall Plains hide many dangers beyond the Stalkers."

As Khal-Zur stepped away to attend to the sanctuary's boundaries, Keen turned to Viên, keeping her voice low.

"Do you trust this... person?" she asked.

Viên considered the question carefully. "I don't know. But I feel a connection to this place, to the patterns here. They resonate with something inside me." He touched the pocket where he'd stored the obsidian fragment. "And we need a guide. Without one, we could wander these plains for weeks without finding the City of Echoes."

Keen nodded, though concern lingered in her expression. "During the jump," she said hesitantly, "you seemed... distressed. Did you see something?"

The vision of blood and transformation flashed through Viên's mind again. Should he tell her? Would she understand when he himself didn't know what it meant?

"I saw..." he began, but found himself unable to articulate the horror of it. "The jumps affect my temporal perception. I saw fragments of... possibilities."

"Possibilities of what?" Keen pressed.

Before Viên could decide how to answer, Khal-Zur returned, carrying what appeared to be containers made from the same petrified wood as the forest around them.

"Sustenance," the being announced, offering them the containers. Inside was a clear liquid that shimmered with faint luminescence. "Ash-dew. It will restore your energies."

Viên accepted the container gratefully, using the interruption to avoid Keen's question for now. The liquid tasted faintly metallic but left a pleasant warmth spreading through his limbs, easing the fatigue from the Seed Jump.

"When we reach the City of Echoes," Viên asked after drinking, "how do we find the dormant Void Spire?"

"The Solantri know," Khal-Zur replied. "The echo-people. They maintain the harmonic pathways beneath the city. Seek Irix Thal, Fifth Harmonic Binder. They can guide you to the spire's chamber."

"And Lentharis? The Observer?" Keen inquired.

"Lost between words. Between realities." Khal-Zur's expression became solemn. "During the Culling, when the spires were silenced, Lentharis remained partially awake. Trapped between activation and dormancy. Their consciousness fractured, seeking refuge in the spaces where reality thins."

The being touched the ground, causing another pattern to illuminate—this one resembling a star chart, but with constellations Viên didn't recognize.

"To awaken Lentharis, you must synchronize your dual natures," Khal-Zur continued. "Temporal and spiritual. Find the resonance point where realities overlap. Where Lentharis hides."

Viên studied the star pattern thoughtfully. "We've done something similar before. But each Observer seems to have their own... requirements."

"Yes. Lentharis will demand truth | memory | sacrifice." Khal-Zur's eyes flared briefly. "They guard the pathway jealously. Trust comes with cost."

As night began to settle more firmly over the Ashfall Plains, the howling of the Umbral Stalkers gradually faded. Khal-Zur explained that they would rest until the next shift of light, when they would begin their journey to the City of Echoes.

Viên found himself unable to sleep, despite the exhaustion from their journey. His mind kept returning to the vision during the Seed Jump—the blood creature that had formed from his own essence. What was it? A premonition? A memory? Something ancient stirring within his Draco bloodline?

He removed the obsidian fragment from his pocket, studying it in the dim light of the sanctuary. The temporal patterns etched into its surface pulsed in perfect synchronization with those beneath his skin, as if they were part of the same whole.

Keen approached quietly, sitting beside him. "Another piece of what you're searching for?" she asked, nodding toward the fragment.

Viên looked up, surprised. "You've noticed?"

"Of course I've noticed," she replied with a faint smile. "Since Xytheria, you've been stopping suddenly, searching around for something only you can sense. Finding things that seem insignificant to anyone else, but clearly mean something to you."

Viên hesitated, uncertain how much to reveal. He still didn't fully understand what he was searching for himself—only that he had glimpsed it during the temporal vision when they first activated the Seed Jump protocol.

"I'm not entirely sure what they are," he admitted finally. "Fragments of... something important. Something I need to find before..." He trailed off, the vision of blood and transformation rising unbidden in his mind.

"Before what?" Keen asked gently.

Viên closed his hand around the obsidian fragment. "Before it's too late."

Across the sanctuary, Khal-Zur watched them with glowing eyes that revealed nothing of the being's thoughts. The ash continued to fall softly around their protected clearing, covering the world in a blanket of gray that held the memory of fire long extinguished.

Tomorrow they would begin their journey to the City of Echoes, to find the dormant Void Spire and its fractured Observer. Another step in their quest to warn Earth about the applicator threat. But as Viên stared into the twilight sky of his ancestral homeland, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was racing against more than just the corruption of the Void Needle network—he was racing against something inside himself, something awakening with each passing day.

The red curse stirred in his blood, patient, waiting for the moment when the transformation would begin.

– Elsewhere in the System: The Anunnaki Stronghold, Orbiting Zar’Vokh]

Beneath the artificial eclipse of Zar’Vokh’s twin moons, the Anunnaki command nexus pulsed with rhythmic precision. Geometric towers rose like bone-white obelisks from the scorched crust of the once-living world, each one tethered to a dormant Void Spire now humming faintly with restored energy.

Inside the central spire—referred to only as Spire-9 Echo Prime—Overseer Thulk stood before the neural lattice, cloaked in a mantle of obsidian and gold-threaded psion mesh. The Void Spire core spiraled behind him, veins of liquid silver crawling upward like reverse lightning, signaling partial reactivation.

“Progress?” he asked, his voice filtered through a chorus of synthetic modulation.

A subordinate—half-flesh, half-drone—bowed deeply. “Spire-9 now responds to directive frequencies. Awaiting anchor consciousness for full stabilization.”

Thulk turned toward the stasis pods lining the chamber walls. One opened with a hiss, revealing a writhing construct of bronze sinew and blackened glass—a hybrid consciousness sculpted from an archived Observer matrix. Its eyes ignited.

“Begin sync sequence,” Thulk commanded. “The others are moving. We will not be late to the Fifth Calling.”

Across the surface of Zar’Vokh, legions of engineered troops were assembling—bipedal constructs, mind-synced pilots, and newly-forged memoryless clones armed with darkwave lances.

The sky above shimmered, revealing an orbiting fleet arranged in sacred geometry.

A tactical officer approached, her body encased in bio-resonant plating. “Reports confirm Seed Jump echoes detected near Umbrageous.”

Thulk’s eyes narrowed. “So... the Zaryonic strain has returned.”

He stepped forward, placing a hand on the control node. The entire chamber surged with Void feedback.

“Let them gather their fragments. We gather our dominion. Soon the harmonics will favor the architects.”

The Void Spire roared to life behind him—no longer dormant.
