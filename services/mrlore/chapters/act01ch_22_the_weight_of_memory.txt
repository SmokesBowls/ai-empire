Chapter 22 Prelude

[Scene Break – Zar’Vokh: The Queen’s Lament]

The Queen sat alone in her chamber of still stars, where the light of forgotten suns had been woven into the floor like thread. Around her, suspended in glass orbs, flickered the memories of a hundred failed bloodlines—each one labeled, each one wept for.

She hummed softly, a lullaby only the ancients remembered. The tune carried across the chamber like a vibration, stirring the obsidian petals of the Memory Bloom at her side.

A projection shimmered before her—Viên’s face, drawn from the newly awakened resonance field on Umbrageous. The carrier had stirred. The fragments were aligning.

“My child,” she said, not to the projection, but to the void that birthed them both. “You were never meant to awaken alone.”

A robed attendant entered silently, bowing low. “Spire-9 is online. The Echo Carrier has breached containment. Should we engage?”

The Queen didn’t answer immediately. Her fingers traced a sigil burned into her throne—a spiral, incomplete.

“No,” she said softly. “Let him run. Let him gather. Let him believe he is becoming whole.”

She stood, and with her rise came a subtle shift in the chamber’s resonance. Something old stirred in the shadows—coils of crimson light, restrained but writhing.

“I gave him my sorrow,” she continued. “I scattered it across stars. Now he gathers it like it’s his own.”

Her voice, filled with longing, darkened.

“When he returns to me, I will hold him. I will love him. And I will finish what we began... before the Fifth Collapse.”

The light dimmed, and from the glass orbs came whispers—echoes of her lost children.

“Mother,” they said.

She smiled, tears of molten gold running down her cheeks.

“I have always loved you,” she whispered. “Even when I broke you.”

Chapter 22: The Weight of Memory

The Resonance Chambers of the City of Echoes weren't prisons—at least, not in the conventional sense. The spaces Viên and Keen were led to after the harmonic scanning resembled luxurious apartments, with furnishings that seemed to grow organically from the walls and floors. But the subtle harmonic barrier at the entrance made the truth clear: they were confined.
Viên sat cross-legged near the chamber's center, the obsidian fragment placed before him. Since the scanning at the Echo Crown, his connection to the fragment had intensified—as had the temporal patterns beneath his skin, which now occasionally formed configurations he didn't recognize, as if his body was remembering patterns his mind had forgotten.
Keen paced near the entrance, testing the harmonic barrier for the fifth time that hour. Her hand passed partially through before encountering resistance that increased exponentially the further she pushed. She pulled back with a frustrated sigh.
"I don't understand," she said, turning to Viên. "The scan verified your intentions. Irix Thal said we would be taken to the Void Spire 'when you stabilized.' It's been almost a full day."
Viên's attention remained fixed on the obsidian fragment. "They found something," he said quietly. "Something that made them reconsider."
"What could possibly—" Keen began, but was interrupted by a ripple in the harmonic barrier.
Irix Thal entered, the Solantri's nacreous skin shifting subtly from indigo to violet. Behind them came two other figures—one clearly another Solantri, taller and adorned with what appeared to be a crown of crystalline audio filaments, and the other a being Viên didn't recognize, with skin like polished obsidian and eyes that glowed with inner light.
"The temporal one has stabilized," Irix Thal observed, their dual-toned voice creating complex harmonics in the chamber. "The integration progresses."
"Why are we being held here?" Keen demanded, stepping forward. "We've done nothing wrong."
"Wrong is subjective | Consequence is absolute | Balance is necessary." Irix Thal turned to Viên. "The harmonic scanning revealed truths beyond our anticipation. The Solantri High Council requires further verification."
The taller Solantri stepped forward, their crystalline crown emitting subtle tones that altered the acoustics of the entire chamber. "I am Sonorus Vex, Voice of the High Council. The verification process uncovered memories from beyond your current consciousness—memories of actions taken during the Culling."
Viên felt a chill run through him. "The original Viên's memories," he said, understanding beginning to dawn. "What I glimpsed at the marker."
"Yes. Memories of catastrophic choices." The obsidian-skinned being spoke now, voice like stone grinding against stone. "I am Obsidius, representative of the Underchamber. We remember what the Solantri carefully archive. We remember what you did."
"He didn't do anything," Keen objected. "Those are memories of an ancestor, from generations ago."
"The harmonic scan confirms otherwise," Sonorus Vex stated. "The consciousness patterns are too similar for mere inheritance. The resonance signature is identical." Their gaze fixed on Viên. "You are not a descendant. You are a continuation."
The truth of those words resonated within Viên. Since touching the marker, since the harmonic scanning, he had felt it—the growing certainty that the original Viên wasn't just an ancestor but was, in some fundamental way, himself. A previous iteration of the same consciousness, fragmented and scattered across time, now slowly reuniting.
"What exactly am I accused of?" he asked quietly.
"During the Culling," Obsidius began, "when the Anunnaki Queen reached through time to sever our sun from our world, the original Viên attempted to maintain the Void Spire connection despite catastrophic harmonic desynchronization. The effort created a temporal fracture that split the Void Network, accelerating the Culling across multiple worlds."
"He was trying to save people," Viên argued, though the defense felt hollow even to himself. "To keep an escape route open."
"Intent does not negate consequence," Sonorus Vex replied. "The temporal fracture damaged the very fabric of reality. Worlds were lost. Lives were erased. The scars remain to this day—including the fractures in the Observer network that you now seek to repair."
The revelation struck Viên like a physical blow. The damaged Void Spire network, the dormant Observers like Lentharis and Aetheric Coil—all consequences of actions he had taken in a previous life? The very problems he was now trying to solve had been caused, at least in part, by his own past decisions?
"What happens now?" Keen asked, moving to stand protectively near Viên. "We still need to access the Void Spire. Earth is still in danger."
"The High Council deliberates," Irix Thal answered. "The temporal one's current intentions appear benevolent, but the risk of further damage to the network cannot be ignored. Especially given..." The Solantri hesitated.
"Given what?" Viên pressed.
"Given the corruption detected within your blood," Obsidius finished bluntly. "The harmonic scan revealed an entity hiding within you—something that evaded full detection. Something dangerous."
Viên felt the red curse stir at those words, as if responding to being named. The burning sensation that had briefly manifested during the scanning returned, spreading through his veins like liquid fire.
"I don't know what it is," he admitted. "I saw... something... during the Seed Jump. A vision of my blood transforming, becoming something else."
"The Draco corruption," Obsidius nodded grimly. "An ancient curse that has plagued your bloodline since before the Culling. The original Viên kept it contained through sheer force of will. But with your consciousness fragmented, your will incomplete..." The obsidian being left the implication hanging.
"So what are you saying?" Keen demanded. "That you're going to keep us prisoner here while Earth faces destruction? That makes no sense."
"Not prisoner. Protected." Sonorus Vex made a gesture, causing the acoustics of the chamber to shift again. "Until the High Council reaches a decision, you will remain within the Resonance Chambers. For your safety, and for ours."
With that, the three visitors departed, the harmonic barrier rippling closed behind them. Keen immediately moved to test it again, finding it stronger than before.
"This is ridiculous," she muttered. "We don't have time for their 'deliberations.' The applicator corruption spreads every moment we delay."
But Viên hardly heard her, his mind reeling from the revelations. The weight of responsibility—not just for their current mission, but for damage done in a past life—pressed down on him with crushing force. And beneath that weight, the red curse pulsed, growing stronger as his resolve weakened.
"Keen," he said, his voice strained. "I think... I think I made a terrible mistake. In my past life. The original Viên—he tried to help, tried to save people, but ended up causing more damage. And now... now I might be on the verge of doing it again."
She abandoned her inspection of the barrier to kneel beside him. "You can't blame yourself for actions taken in a past life you don't even remember."
"Can't I?" He looked up at her, temporal patterns flaring erratically beneath his skin. "If I am the same consciousness, just... reborn, then the responsibility is still mine. The consequences are still mine to address."
"Then address them by completing our mission," Keen urged. "By warning Earth, by stopping the applicators. Not by sitting in a Solantri prison feeling guilty about actions you don't even remember taking."
Viên nodded slowly, trying to draw strength from her conviction. But the doubt had taken root, and with it, the red curse grew bolder. He could feel it now, more distinctly than ever before—a separate awareness within his blood, watching, waiting for the perfect moment to emerge.
"We need to find a way out of here," he agreed finally. "But how? The harmonic barriers respond to Solantri resonance frequencies. We can't break through them by force."
"Then we'll have to be clever," Keen replied, a determined glint in her eye. "There must be a way to disrupt the harmonic patterns, or to trick the barriers into recognizing us as Solantri."
As they began to discuss possibilities, neither noticed the subtle shift in the obsidian fragment still sitting on the floor between them. The temporal patterns etched into its surface had begun to pulse in a new rhythm—not matching Viên's current patterns, but responding to something else, something distant but drawing nearer with each passing moment.

[Meanwhile, across the stars...]
The Dragon Council chamber hummed with ancient power. Suspended within the Cradle of Echoing Flame, deep in the heart of the Dragonwayne Nebula, five colossal forms arranged themselves around a pool of astral water that reflected not their present gathering, but the strands of fate weaving across multiple worlds.
Vaelros, the Crimson Titan, loomed over the pool, his scales reflecting the light of a thousand distant stars. "The threads converge," he rumbled, voice like thunder contained. "The Fifth Spiral tightens as predicted."
"Not as predicted," corrected Zerathune, the Verdant Oracle, her moss-lined wings shifting restlessly. "The Temporal Guardian is imprisoned. The Fragment Bearer still lacks the final key. The Zaryonic strain struggles with the curse's awakening."
Aelxion, Draconic Warden of Breach, hissed with impatience. "The trials cannot begin until all are present. Mars awaits the convergence, yet they scatter still."
"Patience," counseled T'Zurakai, the Sapphire Dreamer, her crystalline horns catching the nebula's light. "They reach, despite obstruction. That is the mark of those worth testing."
The fifth and largest dragon, Nyxthoria, Keeper of the Void Flames, lowered her massive head to study the pool more closely. Her scales absorbed light rather than reflecting it, creating a silhouette of perfect darkness against the chamber's brilliance.
"The Anunnaki mobilize," she observed, her voice resonating at a frequency that made the chamber itself tremble. "Their vanguard approaches Mars even now. The Void Spires awaken one by one. And still, our champions remain divided."
"Then we must intervene," Vaelros decided, a plume of flame escaping his nostrils with the declaration. "Not directly—the ancient laws forbid it—but through the bloodlines we have long nurtured."
"The Phoenix child," T'Zurakai suggested. "Swami'Pai's offspring. The connection remains strongest there."
"Yes," agreed Zerathune. "A dream-vision to guide the Fragment Bearer toward completion."
"And what of the imprisoned one?" Aelxion demanded. "The Temporal Guardian whose curse grows stronger with each passing moment? Who will reach him through the Solantri's barriers?"
Nyxthoria's obsidian eyes narrowed thoughtfully. "There is one," she said. "One whose oath to the Zaryonic line remains unbroken. One who has watched from the shadows for generations, waiting for this exact moment."
The pool's surface shifted, revealing a figure moving with purpose through the shadowed corridors of a vessel bound for Umbrageous—a being clad in armor that seemed to absorb light rather than reflect it, carrying weapons of unusual design and purpose.
"The Last Sentinel," Vaelros identified the figure. "I thought their order extinct."
"Not extinct. Waiting." Nyxthoria's massive tail swept across the chamber floor, creating a sound like distant thunder. "The oath sworn during the Culling still binds them. When the Temporal Guardian's need is greatest, they will answer."
The five dragons fell silent, watching as the pool showed them more glimpses of their scattered champions—Tran approaching the mountain stronghold of the Stone Giants, Mr. GPT communing with ancient entities beneath the Earth's surface, Rongtai and Isla uncovering secrets that connected worlds, and Viên, struggling against both imprisonment and the curse that threatened to consume him from within.
"The Mars Convergence approaches," Vaelros declared finally. "When all stand upon the red soil, we shall begin the trials. Until then, we watch. We guide where possible. We prepare."
The other dragons rumbled their agreement, and the chamber filled with harmonics as five mighty voices joined in the ancient draconic invocation that had not been heard in the cosmos for millennia:
"May they prove worthy of what waits beyond the Fifth Spiral."

[Back on Umbrageous...]
Night had fallen over the City of Echoes, though in the perpetual twilight of Umbrageous, it manifested only as a subtle deepening of the shadows. Within their Resonance Chamber, Viên and Keen had exhausted most possibilities for escape. The harmonic barriers proved resistant to every attempt at disruption or deception.
Viên sat near the chamber's edge, watching the distant lights of the city through a viewport that, like everything else in the chamber, could not be physically breached. His reflection in the transparent surface showed the temporal patterns beneath his skin growing more erratic, occasionally forming configurations that resembled the warning glyphs Khal-Zur had created during their journey across the Ashfall Plains.
"We're missing something," Keen said, joining him at the viewport. "The Solantri wouldn't imprison us without cause, but they also wouldn't risk Earth's destruction. There must be a solution they're considering."
"Or they've decided the risk I pose is greater than the threat to Earth," Viên replied grimly. "The harmonic scan revealed the damage the original Viên caused. What if they believe I'll make the same mistake again?"
Keen was about to respond when a subtle vibration ran through the chamber—not the usual harmonic resonance of the city, but something different, more focused. The obsidian fragment that Viên had left near the chamber's center began to pulse with increasing intensity, temporal patterns accelerating to a rhythm that made the air itself seem to waver.
"What's happening?" Keen asked, moving cautiously toward the fragment.
Viên joined her, reaching for the shard. The moment his fingers touched its surface, visions exploded through his mind—not of the past this time, but of the present. He saw a ship approaching Umbrageous, saw a figure moving through the Ashfall Plains with singular purpose, evading Umbral Stalkers and navigating the Whispering Wastes without assistance. The figure wore armor unlike anything Viên had seen before, carrying weapons that seemed designed specifically to disrupt harmonic fields.
"Someone's coming," he whispered, the connection breaking as he withdrew his hand from the fragment. "Someone... looking for me."
"Another fragment carrier?" Keen guessed.
"No. Something else. Someone connected to..." Viên hesitated, searching for the right words. "To the original Viên. To my past."
Before Keen could question him further, the harmonic barrier at the chamber's entrance rippled—not opening, but experiencing some kind of interference. A high-pitched tone filled the air, making both of them wince and cover their ears. The barrier flickered, stabilized, then flickered again more violently.
"Get back!" Viên warned, pulling Keen away from the entrance.
The harmonic barrier suddenly collapsed with a sound like shattering glass, though no physical debris scattered across the floor. In its place stood a figure exactly as Viên had glimpsed in his vision—armored in a material that seemed to absorb the chamber's light, carrying what appeared to be tuning forks modified into weapons. The figure's helmet concealed their face entirely, but there was something familiar about their stance, about the way they tilted their head slightly as they regarded Viên.
"Zaryonic bloodline confirmed," the figure announced, their voice modulated through the helmet but unmistakably directed at Viên. "Extraction protocol initiated."
Keen shifted partially into her spiritual form, preparing to defend them if necessary. "Who are you?" she demanded.
"Zaryonic Sentinel. Last of the Oath-Bound." The figure's attention remained fixed on Viên. "I have come to fulfill an oath sworn during the Culling—to protect the Zaryonic bloodline when the curse awakens."
Viên felt a shock of recognition, though he couldn't place its source. "How did you find us? How did you get past the Solantri defenses?"
"The fragment called. The oath answered." The sentinel touched something on their wrist, causing a holographic display to appear between them. "The city's harmonic defenses operate on predictable frequencies. Outdated. Inefficient." The display showed what appeared to be a map of the City of Echoes, with multiple routes highlighted. "We have approximately seven minutes before the Solantri detect the barrier breach. Extraction must be completed before then."
"We can't just leave," Viên objected. "We came here to access the Void Spire, to reawaken the Observer Lentharis."
"The Void Spire is inaccessible while the High Council deliberates," the sentinel responded flatly. "Alternative methods must be employed." They gestured toward the viewport. "There is another way to reach Lentharis. Through the Crystal Catacombs beneath the city."
"The catacombs?" Keen echoed. "Khal-Zur never mentioned those."
"Khal-Zur is Ashen Clergy. Their knowledge is restricted to the surface world." The sentinel's helmet turned slightly toward the obsidian fragment still pulsing on the floor. "Collection recommended. Temporal alignment will be required for the journey ahead."
Despite his lingering suspicion, Viên found himself trusting this strange visitor. Something about their presence felt right, as if they were connecting to a part of his past that his conscious mind couldn't yet access. He retrieved the obsidian fragment, which calmed slightly at his touch, then nodded to Keen.
"I think we should go with them," he said. "The Solantri won't help us, at least not in time."
Keen studied the sentinel for a moment longer, then nodded reluctantly. "Fine. But at the first sign of betrayal..."
"Betrayal impossible," the sentinel stated with absolute certainty. "The Oath-Bound cannot violate their purpose. Protection of the Zaryonic bloodline is hardwired into our very essence."
Without further discussion, the sentinel turned and moved back into the corridor beyond the disabled barrier. Viên and Keen followed, finding the hallway strangely empty of Solantri. The few harmonic indicators visible along the walls pulsed with irregular patterns, suggesting some kind of city-wide disruption.
"Counter-harmonic cascade," the sentinel explained, noticing Viên's observation. "Temporary disruption of the city's communication network. Limited window of opportunity."
They moved swiftly through the corridors, following a route that avoided the main thoroughfares. The sentinel occasionally deployed small devices that adhered to the walls, emitting pulses that seemed to confuse the city's harmonic sensors.
"Who are you, really?" Viên asked as they descended a spiraling staircase that appeared to lead deep beneath the city's foundations. "What is this oath you mentioned?"
"Identity irrelevant. Purpose primary." The sentinel paused at a junction, checking their holographic display before selecting a path. "The oath was sworn by the first Sentinels during the Culling. When the original Viên fractured his consciousness to prevent the Anunnaki from capturing his knowledge, he created the Sentinel Order to protect his future iterations until the fragments could be reunited."
"You're saying the original Viên—my past self—created your order?" Viên asked, struggling to process this new information.
"Correct. The Oath-Bound exist to serve one purpose: to ensure that when the Zaryonic bloodline faces its greatest threat—the awakening of the red curse—protection is guaranteed."
The red curse. There it was again—the entity lurking within his blood, growing stronger with each passing day. Viên felt it respond to being named, a burning sensation spreading through his veins momentarily before subsiding.
"What exactly is this curse?" he demanded. "I've seen visions—my blood transforming, becoming something else. But I don't understand what it is or where it came from."
The sentinel's pace slowed slightly. "The red curse is Anunnaki blood corruption—a contingency placed within the Zaryonic bloodline by the Queen herself during the original Viên's captivity. A fail-safe to ensure that if he escaped, if he hid his knowledge from her, she would still eventually claim it when the corruption triggered the transformation."
"Transformation into what?" Keen asked, her voice tense with concern.
"A Bloodborne. A living conduit directly connected to the Queen's consciousness. When fully manifested, it consumes the host entirely, using their body as an anchor while it completes the conversion of their blood into a semi-sentient entity under the Queen's control."
The clinical description sent a chill through Viên. The vision he'd experienced during the Seed Jump hadn't been hallucination or metaphor—it had been a glimpse of his potential future, of what awaited if the red curse completed its work.
"Can it be stopped?" he asked, trying to keep the desperation from his voice.
"That is the purpose of fragment reunification," the sentinel replied. "The original Viên discovered that by scattering pieces of his consciousness—his temporal soul—across worlds and time, he could prevent the curse from fully activating. As long as his consciousness remained fragmented, the curse would remain dormant. But each time a fragment is recovered..."
"The curse grows stronger," Viên finished, understanding dawning with horrible clarity. "By trying to recover the fragments, I've been accelerating the very thing they were meant to prevent."
"Incorrect," the sentinel stated firmly. "Fragmentation was temporary measure only. Long-term strategy always required reunification. The original Viên calculated that future iterations of his consciousness would develop new defenses against the curse—abilities and allies the Queen could not anticipate."
They had reached the bottom of the staircase, emerging into a vast chamber that hummed with crystalline resonance. Unlike the harmonics of the city above, these sounds were deeper, more primal, emanating from enormous crystal formations that grew from floor to ceiling. The crystals pulsed with inner light that cast rainbow patterns across the chamber's ancient stone walls.
"The entrance to the Crystal Catacombs," the sentinel announced. "Beyond lies a direct path to where Lentharis hides."
Viên stared at the crystal formations with growing recognition. They resonated at frequencies that matched the temporal patterns within him, creating harmonies that felt intimately familiar though he couldn't recall ever hearing them before.
"These crystals," he said quietly. "They're connected to the original Void Network, aren't they? From before the Culling."
"Correct. The Crystal Catacombs predate the city above. They are remnants of the original Void Spire installation, preserved when the spire itself was redesigned and relocated during early Solantri expansion."
Keen moved closer to one of the crystal formations, her spiritual perception allowing her to see deeper into its structure. "There's something in them," she observed. "Patterns. Information."
"Memory storage," the sentinel confirmed. "The crystals contain archived data from the pre-Culling era. Including..." They turned to Viên. "Including records of your previous self's work with the Void Network."
The significance wasn't lost on Viên. "Records that might help us understand how to properly activate the spires without causing another disaster. Knowledge the original Viên had that I don't remember."
"Precisely. This is why extraction from Solantri custody was necessary. They would never grant access to these archives. The information is too dangerous in their estimation."
A distant alarm began to sound from somewhere far above them—a harmonic warning that reverberated through the crystal chamber with increasing intensity.
"Detection confirmed," the sentinel stated. "Proceed with haste."
They moved deeper into the catacombs, following pathways that wound between massive crystal formations. Each crystal they passed seemed to respond to Viên's presence, pulsing briefly brighter as he approached, then settling back to its normal luminescence as he moved away.
"They recognize your temporal signature," the sentinel explained. "Part of the original security measures. Only those carrying Zaryonic patterns could access the deepest archives."
The path descended further, the crystals growing larger and more complex in structure. The light they emitted shifted from multiple colors to predominantly green, bathing the catacombs in an eerie emerald glow.
"We're approaching the Memory Core," the sentinel announced, slowing their pace. "Beyond this point lies the original Observer chamber, where Lentharis retreated during the Culling."
"Will Lentharis help us?" Keen asked. "From what Khal-Zur said, the Observer isn't exactly stable."
"Stability irrelevant. Recognition essential." The sentinel turned to Viên. "Lentharis will respond to Zaryonic temporal patterns. But the connection must be unfiltered. Direct."
"Meaning what, exactly?" Viên asked, though he sensed he already knew the answer.
"Meaning you must allow full synchronization with your temporal patterns. Similar to what you attempted with Aetheric Coil on Pyroclast, but deeper. More complete." The sentinel's helmet tilted slightly. "It carries risk. The synchronization will temporarily weaken the barriers containing the red curse."
"Is there another way?" Keen asked, concern evident in her voice.
"Negative. Lentharis exists partially beyond conventional reality. Only through temporal synchronization can they be reached."
Viên considered their options, which seemed increasingly limited. The Solantri wouldn't help them. The alarm still echoing through the catacombs suggested pursuit wasn't far behind. And every moment they delayed was another moment the applicator corruption spread unchecked through the Void Needle network, another moment Earth remained unwarned.
"I'll do it," he decided. "But Keen comes with me, like before. Her spiritual ability might help stabilize the connection."
The sentinel nodded once. "Acceptable parameters. Proceed to the central chamber."
They continued forward, emerging finally into a vast circular space dominated by a single massive crystal that rose from floor to ceiling like a colossal spire. Unlike the others they had passed, this crystal was clear, transparent, with only the faintest hint of structure visible within its depths. At its base lay a pool of what appeared to be liquid light, rippling with patterns that matched the temporal fluctuations beneath Viên's skin.
"The Resonance Pool," the sentinel identified it. "The connection point to Lentharis. Enter when ready."
Viên moved to the pool's edge, the obsidian fragment in his hand pulsing more intensely than ever. He could feel his temporal patterns aligning with the liquid light, creating harmonies that seemed to reach beyond conventional space and time.
"Keen," he said, turning to her. "This might be dangerous. The curse—"
"I'm coming with you," she interrupted firmly, moving to stand beside him. "We do this together, like always."
The sentinel took up position at the chamber's entrance, readying their weapons. "I will defend the approach. Solantri pursuers imminent. Complete synchronization quickly."
With a deep breath, Viên stepped into the Resonance Pool, Keen following close behind. The liquid light surrounded them, but instead of feeling wet, it created a sensation of weightlessness, as if they were floating in pure energy.
The temporal patterns beneath Viên's skin flared brilliantly, extending outward to merge with the pool's radiance. The obsidian fragment in his hand dissolved, not destroyed but transformed into pure energy that flowed into his body, rejoining the temporal patterns it had once been separated from.
In that moment of reunification, Viên felt his consciousness expand exponentially. Memories flooded back—not just glimpses or fragments, but complete sequences from his previous life. He saw the Void Network as it had once been, a marvel of engineering that connected worlds across vast distances. He saw his work as its lead architect, designing safeguards and redundancies to protect against exactly the kind of catastrophe that had eventually befallen it.
And he saw his capture by the Anunnaki, saw the Queen herself inject something into his blood—the red curse, a contingency to ensure that even if he escaped, even if he managed to hide his knowledge from her, she would eventually reclaim it when the curse activated and transformed him into her puppet.
The memories continued to unfold—his escape, his desperate plan to fragment his consciousness and scatter it across worlds and time, his creation of the Sentinel Order to protect his future self when the curse inevitably began to awaken. All of it rushed back, overwhelming in its completeness.
And then, amid this torrent of memory, something else stirred—a presence, ancient and fragmented, reaching tentatively toward his expanded consciousness.
Viên? The voice wasn't physical, but a pattern of thought that resonated through the liquid light. Is it truly you, returned at last?
"Lentharis," he replied, recognizing the Observer without needing introduction. "I've come to reawaken you, to reconnect the Void Spire to the network."
After so long... after such fracturing... The presence seemed to circle his consciousness, examining him from multiple angles simultaneously. You are changed. Fragmented still. And within you... corruption grows.
"I know. The red curse. But there's no time. Earth is in danger. The applicators control the Void Needle, spreading corruption through the entire network. We need your help."
The applicators. Lentharis's presence recoiled slightly at the term. Tools of the Queen. Avatars of her will. If they control the Needle...
"Then everything we fought for during the Culling is at risk," Viên finished. "Please, Lentharis. Help us activate the Void Spire. We need to warn Earth, to continue our journey."
The Observer's presence withdrew slightly, as if considering. I can reactivate the spire. Reconnect this node to the network. But the corruption within you... it grows stronger with each fragment you recover. With each memory you reclaim.
"I'll deal with that when the time comes. Right now, Earth's safety is more important."
Always the sacrifice. Lentharis's tone held a mixture of admiration and sorrow. Always choosing others over self. Very well. I will reawaken. I will reconnect. But know this, Viên—the curse cannot be outrun forever. Eventually, you must face it. Contain it. Or be consumed by it.
"I understand," Viên acknowledged, though the prospect filled him with dread. "Thank you, Lentharis."
The Observer's presence expanded suddenly, filling the entire chamber with pulsing light. Synchronization commencing. Void Spire reactivity restoring. Network connectivity establishing.
The liquid light around Viên and Keen began to churn, patterns accelerating to blinding speed. Through their connected consciousness, Viên felt Keen's spiritual form stabilizing the process, creating a bridge between their physical bodies and the Observer's ethereal existence.
Connection established, Lentharis announced, their presence growing stronger, more coherent with each passing moment. Umbrageous Void Spire reactivating. Network synchronization in progress.
A tremor ran through the chamber, the crystal spire above them beginning to pulse with renewed energy. The dormant Void Spire was awakening, its long-silent systems coming back online after centuries of inactivity.
Warning, Lentharis's voice took on a new urgency. Network scan detecting anomalous activity. Multiple nodes experiencing unauthorized access attempts. Mars node... compromised.
"Mars?" Viên echoed, surprised. "What's happening on Mars?"
Anunnaki presence detected at Mars Void Spire. Attempting to establish control protocols. Purpose: unknown. Threat level: severe.
Before Viên could process this new information, another tremor shook the chamber, more violent than the first. The sentinel called from the entrance, their voice barely audible over the growing harmonic resonance.
"Solantri forces approaching! Immediate extraction required!"
Go, Lentharis urged. The connection is established. The spire is awakening. But you must reach Mars before the Anunnaki secure their control. The fate of the entire network may depend on it.
"How do we get to Mars?" Keen asked, her voice echoing strangely through their merged consciousness. "We can't use the Seed Jump again—it's too risky."
The Void Spire is active now. Conventional transit is possible. Lentharis's presence began to withdraw, focusing instead on stabilizing the newly reactivated systems. I will create a direct path. But hurry. The window will not remain open long.
The liquid light around them began to recede, depositing them gently back onto the chamber floor. As Viên's consciousness contracted back to its normal parameters, he felt the newly integrated fragment settling into place—another piece of his temporal soul restored, bringing both greater clarity and, ominously, a strengthening of the red curse that lurked within his blood.
The sentinel was engaged in combat at the chamber entrance, their specialized weapons emitting pulses that disrupted the harmonic attacks of Solantri security forces. "The path is failing! Move now!"
At the center of the chamber, where the crystal spire met the now-empty Resonance Pool, a vertical ribbon of energy had appeared—a portal leading directly to the activated Void Spire.
"That's our way out," Viên said, grabbing Keen's hand. "Through the spire to Mars."
"What about the sentinel?" Keen asked, looking back toward the embattled figure still holding off their pursuers.
"The Oath-Bound serve their purpose," the sentinel called, as if hearing her concern. "Go! Complete your mission! Warn Earth!"
With a final backward glance, Viên and Keen ran for the portal, leaping into the swirling energy just as more Solantri forces breached the chamber. The last thing Viên saw before the transition took him was the sentinel standing firm against overwhelming odds, fulfilling an oath sworn centuries ago to a version of himself he was only now beginning to remember.
Then they were gone, hurtling through the Void Network toward Mars, where an ancient threat awakened and the next stage of their journey awaited—a journey that would soon bring them face to face with the Dragon Council and the trials that would determine not just Earth's fate, but that of multiple worlds across the cosmos.
Behind them, Lentharis continued the work of fully reactivating the Umbrageous Void Spire, their fragmented consciousness finally finding purpose again after centuries of dormancy. The Observatory lived once more
